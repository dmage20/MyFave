Technical Assignment 01

Fave Information Gathering
Back story
Imagine you are working with one of Fave’s competitor. One day your Head of Business Development called you, and she said it’s crucial for the company to get more merchants listed. She told you to take a look at Fave and see if there’s something you can do to get the list of Fave’s merchants. It would be a tremendous help to the company.
You are appalled by her request. But your rational brain took over and said, “Hey, if it’s publicly available, everyone can consume the data.”
So you said okay, and you’ll see what you can do. You set off to work.
You know she wants a list of merchants so the company can acquire them. Which means you need to include at least necessary contact information like name, location, & contact information. She can start working with that.
But you also know, it would be awesome if you can do much more than that. Maybe you can map out the merchant clusters in a simple app. Or perhaps you can make a searchable list. Heck, perhaps you can just write an API interface that leverages on Fave app or website that she can access anytime. Yay!
Oh, and you have meant to learn that new language anyway. This is a perfect opportunity to fire up new neurons. You smile to yourself and start typing.
Instructions
